Here is an example of Fermi surface of fcc Iridium. 
In ir.save directory there are files produced with help of Quantum Espresso.
File sum is an input, which you have to construct on the basis of the output
from Quantum Espresso (proj.out). Inspect proj.out, if you wish understand
file sum.

What you need to do:
1) python ../FS_read_proj.py
    type: ir
    type: y
2) python ../FS_plot_proj.py
    type: y
    type: 0 for p-states of Ir or 1 for s-states of Ir

Then you see the Mayavi's window with Fermi surface plotted.

In folder expected-results you'll find expected results, including
*.png file with expected image of the Fermi surface.
